12.2 The Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations
The 2D flow-field of an incompressible fluid is completely described by the velocity vector q = (u(x, y), v(x, y)) ∈ R2 and the pressure p(x, y) ∈ R. These functions are a solution of the following conservation laws (see, for instance, Hirsch, 1988): • mass conservation: div(q)=0, (12.1) or, written using the explicit form of the divergence1 operator, ∂u ∂x + ∂v ∂y = 0. (12.2) • the momentum conservation equations in the compact form2 ∂q ∂t + div(q ⊗ q) = −Gp + 1 Re∆q, (12.3) or, in explicit form, ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩ ∂u ∂t + ∂u2 ∂x + ∂uv ∂y = −∂p ∂x + 1 Re ∂2u ∂x2 + ∂2u ∂y2  , ∂v ∂t + ∂uv ∂x + ∂v2 ∂y = −∂p ∂y + 1 Re ∂2v ∂x2 + ∂2v ∂y2  . (12.4) 1 We recall the definitions of the differential operators divergence, gradient, and Laplacian for a 2D field: if v = (vx, vy) : R2 → R2 and ϕ : R2 → R, then div(v) = ∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y , Gϕ = 
∂ϕ ∂x , ∂ϕ ∂y  , ∆ϕ = div(Gϕ) = ∂2ϕ ∂x2 + ∂2ϕ ∂y2 , and ∆v = (∆vx, ∆vy). 2 We denote by ⊗ the tensor product. 12.3 Numerical Algorithm 253 The previous equations are written in the dimensionless form, using the following scaled variables: x = x∗ L , y = y∗ L , u = u∗ V0 , v = v∗ V0 , t = t ∗ L/V0 , p = p∗ ρ0V 2 0 , (12.5) where the superscript (∗) denotes variables measured in physical units. The constants L, V0 are, respectively, the reference length and velocity that characterize the simulated flow. The dimensionless number Re is called the Reynolds number and quantifies the relative importance of inertial (or convective) terms and viscous (or diffusion)3 terms in the flow: Re = V0L ν , (12.6) where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the flow. To summarize, the Navier–Stokes system of PDEs that will be numerically solved in this project is defined by (12.2) and (12.4); the initial condition (at t = 0) and the boundary conditions will be discussed in the following sections.

12.4 Computational Domain, Staggered Grids, and Boundary Conditions Numerically solving the Navier–Stokes equations is considerably simplified by considering a rectangular domain Lx × Ly (see Fig. 12.1) with periodic boundary conditions everywhere. The periodicity of the velocity q(x, y) and pressure p(x, y) fields is mathematically expressed as q(0, y) = q(Lx, y), p(0, y) = p(Lx, y), ∀y ∈ [0, Ly], (12.21) q(x, 0) = q(x, Ly), p(x, 0) = p(x, Ly), ∀x ∈ [0, Lx]. (12.22) The points at which the solution will be computed are distributed in the domain following a rectangular and uniform 2D grid. Since not all the variables share the same grid in our approach, we first define a primary grid (see 256 12 Fluid Dynamics: Solving the Two-Dimensional Navier–Stokes Equations Fig. 12.1) generated by taking nx computational points along x and, respectively, ny points along y: xc(i)=(i − 1)δx, δx = Lx nx − 1 , i = 1,...,nx, (12.23) yc(j)=(j − 1)δy, δy = Ly ny − 1 , j = 1,...,ny. (12.24)
 
Fig. 12.1. Computational domain, staggered grids, and boundary conditions. A secondary grid is defined by the centers of the primary grid cells: xm(i)=(i − 1/2)δx, i = 1,...,nxm, (12.25) ym(j)=(j − 1/2)δy, j = 1,...,nym, (12.26) where we have used the shorthand notation nxm = nx−1, nym = ny−1. Inside a computational cell defined as the rectangle [xc(i), xc(i + 1)] × [yc(j), yc(j + 1)], the unknown variables u, v, p will be computed as approximations of the solution at different space locations: • u(i, j) ≈ u(xc(i), ym(j)) (west face of the cell), • v(i, j) ≈ v(xm(i), yc(j)) (south face of the cell), • p(i, j) ≈ p(xm(i), ym(j)) (center of the cell). This staggered arrangement of the variables has the advantage of a strong coupling between pressure and velocity. It also helps (see the references at the end of the chapter) to avoid some problems of stability and convergence experienced with collocated arrangements (where all the variables are computed at the same grid points).
